TODO:

- Add support for modifier key filtering in xd::window
- Create xd::factory and xd::create (Boost PP iteration magic since MSVC doesn't support variadic templates)
- C++ lua scheduler to allow scheduling of co-routines created by xd
- Implement xd::scene_graph based on xd::entity
- Improve xd::vertex_traits to support less versatile syntax for standard-layout types, but also support eg. float arrays
- Audio stuff (streaming bgm/loading sfx, possibly some simple effect stuff)
- Create xd::config (or similar) that can be used to read/write configuration files, and also passed to components such as xd::window
- Finish binding xd code to lua
- Comment code more thoroughly
- Write documentation/tutorials (ugh)
- *POSSIBLY* Add support for operator[] for bound classes in luabind
- *POSSIBLY* Add support for Python via Boost.Python
- *POSSIBLY* Add support for signed distance field fonts (fonts can be rendered at any size accurately + enables more effects)
