XD is a simple framework for modern OpenGL with aim to provide a solid
barebones for writing OpenGL 3.x based games, however it is not a game engine.

To get started take a look at the test project source code at src/test/
When adding new features to XD, the plan is to also demonstrate these features
in the test project. Later on more example projects will be added (like pong).

XD separates its core concepts into few different libraries so
the programmer can freely pick only the ones he neeeds:

common
------
For common classes and types, required by all other libraries

system
------
Window management, input handling, etc.

graphics
--------
Utility classes and tools for working with common OpenGL graphic
concepts such as vertices, shaders, vertex batches, textures,
matrix stacks, geometry transformation, etc.

audio (PLANNED)
-----
Tools to work with audio data like streaming music, sound effects, etc.

scripting (PLANNED)
---------
A library to make it easier for you to embed scripting capabilities
into your game, possibly providing way to bind xd's own subsystems.
The first supported scripting language will most likely be V8,
but it'd be possible to support other languages like Lua.
One feature that would be hugely useful is making a common interface
for binding C++ functions/classes into the scripting vm, but this
might be difficult without making compromises due to many scripting
languages being so different. Maybe make a simplified common bind API.


XD depends on many third party libraries to deliver its features.
Here's a list of the dependancies and which components depend on them:

boost     all components
glew      system, graphics
glm       graphics
SDL       system, requires version 1.3

Planned dependancies:

DevIL     graphics, for image/texture loading
FMOD EX   aduio
